# prettydot
Goal:
A .dot-file viewer that acts like it's the 2000s

Reason for idea:
- Intuitive doxygen code call graphs of large code bases
- Intuitive debian package dependency graphs
Hope to make understanding complex systems a tiny bit easier than the hairball-navigation that is native to doxygen at the moment.

Potential libs:

- http://sigmajs.org/
