# prettydot

Installation:
=============
```
sudo apt-get install npm git
git clone git@github.com:Chetic/prettydot
sudo npm install
nodejs bin/www
chrome 127.0.0.1:3311
```
Goal:
A .dot-file viewer that acts like it's the 2000s

Reason for idea:
- Intuitive doxygen code call graphs of large code bases
- Intuitive debian package dependency graphs
Hope to make understanding complex systems a tiny bit easier than the hairball-navigation that is native to doxygen at the moment.
